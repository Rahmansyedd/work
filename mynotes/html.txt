html:
hyper text markup language 
developed in the year 1993 by Tim Berner lee
current version html 5
it is also know as the most basic budling block of the web
html is used to structure the content of a web page
the link available in the any website for connecting webpages are give with the help of html
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CSS: 
cascading style sheet
CSS used color values to specify colors
color also specified using predefine color name, rgb and hex values.

-----------------
background properties
there are several different types of background properties in css
background-img
background-repeat
background-position
////////////
background - image:url("nature.jpg");
backgground-size:500px;//cover;
background-repeat: no-repeat;

---------------------------

css selectors: use to find there elements using there id,class etc
type of selectors:
there are several selectors most common selectors are 
element selectors: select element using name for example p h. tags
id selectors: select the element with specific id
class selectors
universal selectors
group selectors
-----------------------------------
----------------------------------------
JavaScript:
use to validate to validate the user data
JavaScript is a light weight scripting lang
it is dynamical type scripting language

DOM :DOCUMENT OBLECT MODEL
DOM is a api for html and xml document
api means the mediator between the JavaScript and the html documents 
equal{=} symbol to assigned a value
i.e. var bike name;
bike name = TVs;
document, write (bike name);

let bike name;
bike name = TVs;
document, write (bike name);
we can repeat same variable in different sscope it will not creat any proble but it will not allow to redeclare any declare value.
  
const: if we don't want to change values and that will neve change
we can change the properties of constant objects
const  x =5, y= 7;
const z=x+y;
document. Write(z);

datatypes: every programming has a own set of datatypes which is unique in its own way
there are two types of datatypes.///////it is a kind of data which store in variable's

1.primative datatypes :store in stack; base on datatypes
divided in to 5 categories there are numbers, Boolean, string, undefined, and null

2.nonprimative datatypes : store in he ;are derive or object
it is complex data types there are divided in to 2 categories there are arrays and objects.
i e  document. Write(type of(x));
-------------------------------------------------
control statements: are also instructions ////if we want to make a certain dissension in JavaScript the we use control statement
                                        control statement
                                                 |
                        ----------------------------------------------------
		       |                                                   |
             condition statement                                     iterative statements
                 |        |                                        |      |      |        |
             if else   switch                                     for   while  do while  for in

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
switch case control statement:
use to find the numerical numbers and give output in text for example months 4 means(April)
much more efficient then if else when its come to execution time

break statement: use to print only one output i.e. January ////not both January and February 
---------------------------------
for loop in js: 
are use when we want to perform a activity multiple times or n numbers of times
there are for types fo loops 
for loop:

we use for loop when we are clear with the number of iterations in advance
we have installation decorations 
if we want to print table of 10 the use this
for(var a=1;a<=10;a++)
{document.write("<h1>"+10*a"<\h1>");}
-----------------------------------
while loop: when we are taking i put from user and the input is Y the print will work and the in put is N then the process will stop
var x=1
while(x<=50)
{document.write("<h1>"+x+"<\h1>");
x+=2;}
----------------------------------------
do-wile loop:
var x=6;
do{document.write(x+""+"welcome");x--;}while{x>5};
-----------------------------------------------------
prime number are not use in loops
--------------------------------------
amstrong number using while loop:
153 is amstrong number
parse will do convert the float value in integer

const in js:keyword use to declare the variable
variable:container of storing information
document.querySelectorAll: use to select group of elements in a DOM(document object element)
addEventListener: it is a build in function allows you to attached event handler to an specific element .ex button or link 
QUARYSELECTOR:allows you to select the first element within the document that matches a specified CSS selector.

back-end developer:
backend developer role is to focus on the details  like budling the effective websites architecture scripting and writing the code and maintaining the communication between the database and the browser
application  programming interfaces'	


angular:
data binding: allows an internet user to manipulate webpage element using a web browser it is used for web pages that contains interactive components such as forms calculators, tutorials and games
angular is two way data binding


angular os a full-fledged MVC frameworks
mvc:model view controller

why angular: angular and JavaScript brings structure and consistency to web application development. And provide scalability and maintainability
angular is specially developed for single page application 

what is angular: angular is a open source  JavaScript framework.it is completely written in typescript primarily aim to developed single page application it us html syntax to express your application components clearly maintain by google it is designe for  web desktop and mobile platforms
features of angular :
(DOM) Document object model: treats an xml html document as a tree structure in which each node is an object representing a part of the document
typescript is a super set of java script
databinding
and testing: angular use Jasmin for testing
---------------------
advantages in angular :custom components, data binding, dependency injection, testing
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
limitations:
limited seo,  hard to learn ,complex, migration
index.html responsible to which file has to be loaded
main.ts: angular model is to be loaded when the applications starts
------------------------------
commands:
ng new app
dependency injection: we can used it by services
n g s name
in services component create arrays
export class record service{
info1 : string["adam",'e132','at @abc.net']
info2 : string["adam",'e132','at @abc.net']
info3 : string["adam",'e132','at @abc.net']
getinfo1() :string[]{return this.info1}
getinfo2() :string[]{return this.info1}
getinfo3() :string[]{return this.info1}}
emp-info file add 3 arrays
inforecive1: string[]=[];
inforecive1: string[]=[];
inforecive1: string[]=[];
then
import services
declare provider:[recordservices]

creat a object
in constructor(private rservice : recordsservice){}

------------------------------------------------------------
to update npm {npm i --save--dev @angular/cli@latest}
