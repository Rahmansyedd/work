sql
----
create database age;
drop database age;  => to delete database
drop database if exists age;
use college => which database you want to use
CREATE DATABASE if not exists college; => for creating database without error if the data base is already eXist
show database;=> to show all database

tables in sql
-------------
use college;

creat table student(
);
using numbers use int primary key
varchar is use to number of words we write
 
for inserting data in to database:
insert into student values(1,"aman",24);

for print or seeing table
select *from student
----------
data type in sql
char- it will reserve hole space for pune////char(50)
varchar- will take how much space it want for pune////varchar(50)
blob - it can store large binary objects////blob(1000)
int - for storung integet valuse will use int//////int
tinyint-small verssion og int /////tinyint
bigint- big version of int ////bigint
bit - can store x-bit values x range from 1 to 64 ie:bit(2)can store only 2 values , bit(3) we can store 3 values.
float - for storing decimal values :-12.5////float
double - for storing big  decimal numbers////double
boolean - for storing true or false values are 0 or 1///boolean
for useing boolean first will use tinyint bcoz in tiny int zero will store
date - wil store dates////date
year - will store year /////year	
-------------------------------------
sql datatypes:
signed :means both the numeric  values positive and negative  wil come in signed
-------
 unsigned :in this all posituve will come for example salary and age.

------------------------------------
sql commands:
DDL{data defination language}:creat ,alter,remane, truncate & drop
DQL:data query language:select;
DML:data manipulattion language :insert update delete
DCL:data controle language: grant 7revoke premision to users
TCL transaction controle language:start transaction,commit, rollbacks
---------------------
table related queries:
creat table student(
rollno int primary key, name varchar(50));
----------------------------------
for inserting data into table :
insert into student
(rollno, name)values(101,"kiran"),(102,"arjun")
for inserting  one value we can use: insert into student values (104,"shyam");
--------------------------------------
keys:special coloms are called keys two types of keys are there primary kry and foreign key 
primary key : means it uniquely identifi the id in table rows there is only one primary keyit will not null
foreign key  : is the set of colums or set of columns in a table that reffers to the primery key there is multiple foreign keys
-------------------------
constraints: sql constraints are used to specify rules for data in a table
not null : cloumn cannot have a null value{col1 int not null}
unique : all values in column are different{col2 int unique} 
foreign keys:prevent actions that would destroy links between tables
---------------
default constrains:addd salary defaulty
create table emp(
id int ,
salary int default 25000
);

insert into emp (id) values(101);
-------------
check:it can limit the values allowed in a coloumn
create table city(id int primary key,city varchar(50),age int,constraint age_check check (age>=18and city ="hyd"));
------------------------------------
select details:
use to select any data from the database
select distinct,name, marks from student;
distinct means select only unique cities
-----------------------------
 where clause:to define some conditions
select * 
from student
where marks >80;
======
select * 
from student
where marks>80 and city="Hyderabad";
operators in where:
arthmwtic operator:addition subtraction multiplication division modulus
comparasion operator:equla to ,notequal to,>,>=,<,<=
logical operatirs:and or not in between all like any
bitwise operator:&(bitwist),(bitwise or)
--------------------------
limit clause:sets an upper limit on number of (tuples) rows to be returned
select * 
from student 
limit 3;
--------------------------------
order by clause:
to store in ascending or descending order
------------------------------
aggregate function:-perform a calculation on a set of values and a single values ,,,count() max(),min(), sum(), avg().
select max(marks) 
from student;
select count(rollno) 
from student;
-----------------------------
group by clause:
it groups rows that have the same value into summary rows it collect data from multiple records the result by one or more column.
select city ,count(rollno)
from student
group by city;
-----------------
having clause:similar to where applies some conditionds on rows used when we want to apply any condition after grouping
select city, count(rollno)
 from student
group by city
having max(marks) > 90;
----------------
general order :

select city, count(rollno)
from student
where grade = "A"
group by city
having max(marks) > 93
order by city desc 
--------------------------
table related queries:
UPDATE:
use to updating the rows in a table

before updating have to write a comments 
SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATE=0;
to avoid 117 error 
update student
set grade = "O"
where grade = "A";

DELETE:
uset o delete existing  row
delete from student
 where marks <33;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
revisiting foreign key:

cascading for FK: 
on delete cascadnig :when we crate a foregin key using this option,it deletes the referance rows in the child table whem the referance row is deleted in the parent table which has a primary key

on update cascading:
when we crate a fk usong update cascade the referance roes are in the child table when the refereace row os updated in the parent table which has a primary key
