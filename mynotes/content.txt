AutoCAD:-
---------
1.To make it simple for a telecom/electric construction engineer to locate exactly where the hand holes should be placed and to aid the engineer in understanding the area by providing all the details about the obstructions (such as utility lines, driveways, sidewalks, etc.) that they may encounter while working on site.


2.In AutoCAD, we have expertise in both 2D drafting and 3D Works. We have experience in working on Telecom/electric construction site designs. In Telecom/electric construction site designs, We have done 2D draftings on each area, inorder to  make it simple for a telecom/electric construction engineer to locate exactly where the hand holes should be placed and to aid the engineer in understanding the area by providing all the details about the obstructions (such as utility lines, driveways, sidewalks, etc.) that they may encounter while working on site.


Augmented Reality
-----------------
Using a mobile device, headset, or pair of glasses, augmented reality (AR), an interactive technology, superimposes digital content onto the physical world. Our augmented reality initiatives entail developing immersive experiences for a range of sectors, including education, gaming, and retail. We create AR applications that combine computer vision, 3D modelling, and real-time object detection to increase user engagement and better learning results.

DevOps and Automation
-----------------------
Software development and IT operations are combined through the use of automated tools and procedures in DevOps and automation. Our initiatives entail using continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous testing to build and deploy applications more quickly and more effectively. To increase dependability and scalability, we also use infrastructure as code, containerization, and monitoring tools.
